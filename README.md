## Features

- Configurable formpage / pageswitch form-field with conditions for submitted values
- A Guest mode to show specific form pages for guests only
- Does not display form-pages when conditions are not met
- Sends all collected data on specific form page
- Compatible with all form-fields from contao

## How to install the package

Install the package by using following command:

```
composer require oveleon/contao-advanced-form
```

After installing the contao-advanced-form-bundle, you should run a contao install to add the new fields.

The extension cannot be used or installed at the same time as [MP_Forms from Terminal24](https://github.com/terminal42/contao-mp_forms)

## How does contao advanced form work

Once the installation is complete, you will be able to use a new field type called "Formpage" within Contao Forms that does act as a divider for created form fields (i.e.: radio button menu, textarea, etc.).

The 'formpage' form-field acts as a page-switch and you will be redirected to it if the condition from previous submitted values is met.

## Initial setup

1. Set up your form as usual and create your form-fields


2. Create 'formpage' fields between the form-fields that should be divided into pages

3. Add a 'submit button label' into your form-page


4. In case you want a button to get to your previous page, add a 'back button label' as well


## Advanced setup for conditions

1. Follow the initial setup mentioned above


2. Create values that can be submitted (e.g. Radio button menu) above the form-page that should meet the condition

3. Activate the "Add condition" checkbox and write your condition into it

## Important Information
### Creating Form Pages

- The first form-page will always be divided by the first form-field and the first 'Formpage'-field.

- Following form-pages are created by wrapping them with 'Formpage'-fields.

- The last field in your form needs to be a 'Formpage'-field, otherwise it will show all form-fields (This is great to debug through your form).

### Conditions

> Conditions within page-switches (Formpages) will always work for the 
>
> **FOLLOWING** 
> 
> form-fields up to the next page-switch (Formpage)

### Syntax
```
 ${Field name of radio button menu} == '{Value of radio button menu}'
```
A radio button menu with a field name of **'Example1'**, and a submitted value of **'Option1'** will jump to this page-switch (form-page).
```
 $Example1 == 'Option1'
```

You are able to set-up complex conditions to show a certain form-page.
The following PHP functions can be used within the condition:

- floatval
- strval
- intval
- in_array
- str_contains

If more functionality is needed, feel free to create a feature issue.

### Buttons
